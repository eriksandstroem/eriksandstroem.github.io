Hi, my name is Erik!

I am a doctoral student at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My supervisor is [Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) and my co-supervisor is [Martin R. Oswald](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/moswald/).

Before I began my doctoral studies in September 2019, I studied engineering physics at Lund University, earning a Master's degree. I spent half of my masters at the University of California San Diego, where I worked at the Statistical Visual Computing Lab.

## Research Interests

The goal of my research is to attain high-quality dense 3D reconstructions of scenes using online methods. I have worked on a quite broad range of problems from sensor fusion, uncertainty estimation, 3D representations, loop closure and RGB-only SLAM.

I also have a great interest in teamwork and I truly enjoy passing on my own experience and knowledge within the field to aspiring students. Therefore, I collaborate and supervise students at master level.
