Hi, my name is Erik!

I am a doctoral student at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich. My supervisor is [Luc Van Gool](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/people-details.OTAyMzM=.TGlzdC8zMjQ4LC0xOTcxNDY1MTc4.html) and my co-supervisor is [Martin R. Oswald](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/moswald/).

Before I began my doctoral studies in September 2019, I studied engineering physics at Lund University, earning a Master's degree. I spent half of my masters at the University of California San Diego, where I worked at the Statistical Visual Computing Lab.

## Research Interests

The goal of my research is to attain high-quality dense 3D reconstructions of scenes using online methods. Previously, I have focused on how complementary sensor information can be fused for optimal 3D quality, online sensor uncertainty estimation and representations for dense 3D models. Applications include robotic perception as well as augmented and virtual reality.

I also have a great interest in teamwork and I truly enjoy passing on my own experience and knowledge within the field to aspiring students. Therefore, I collaborate and supervise students at master level.
